# AnimatedTVHeadV1
![Preview of the Tvhead neutral state](/ReadMeMedia/Tvhead.jpg)
A repo for my animated tvhead cosplay. 
* Currently, the face will blink and move her pupils' location after a random number of seconds have passed. 
* The face also has a "no signal" facial expression if the LED matrix is tilted down.
* The mouth will animate as I talk and, depending on the noise level, will have a different look.
